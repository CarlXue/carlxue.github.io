title: Is changing bad? Or it's new technology's fault

Currently I'm two years in to my professional developing career, 4 years into developing. Before that I was studying pharmaceutical engineering in China. I worked for a 'small' local retail business which only had about 10 employees. After it went out of business, I moved onto a big corporate which has 16 thousand employees across the globe.
